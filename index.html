    <h1>Vigil Final Project</h1>
    <p>There are many browsers to choose from nowadays but this page will help you decide which browser is best for you and your safety.

        Microsoft Edge comes pre-installed on every windows device and generally gets the job done when it comes to basic needs for a browser. It has fast download speeds and is generally safe. However, it isn't as customizable as the other chrome based browsers are. Another drawback is the limited extensions and plugins catalogue. Overall, Microsoft Edge is a decent browser for the common user but there are other browsers that perform better in the areas where Edge is weaker.
        
        Google Chrome is the current most popular browser in the world. Chrome is extremely fast and reliable. It is also very customizable and has a wide array of plugins and extensions to customize your experience. Chrome has a few performance based drawbacks however. On some systems, Chrome can slow down the system due to how many resources are being used to run the browser. This can result in slower speeds and can be very annoying to put up with. Chrome also collects a lot of data from its users which rubs a lot of people the wrong way. Chrome is a decent browser but if you are worried about performance, it might not be right for you.  
        
        Mozilla Firefox is a secure and reliable browser. It doesn't collect as much data as other browsers do and it doesn't require many system resources to run it. However, the drawbacks for Firefox are the browser being a but slower than other browsers and an abundance of ads on the starting page. Firefox has decent security features and allows the user to safely browse the web without being watched by Google or Microsoft constantly.
        
        Opera GX is my personal browser of choice. It has decent security features, a built in VPN and has many different customization options. With Opera, you can have videos or streams playing in a side window while you use the main browser. The speed of the browser is about average but there are many options to limit how many resources the browser can use. There are many theme options which change how the browser can look and sound. Overall, a really solid browser that I use everyday and I haven't personally had any issues with it.
        
        Safari is the main browser for all Apple products. It is fast, secure, and reliable. It also has many developer features hidden away in the settings section that can help you optimize the browsing experience to your liking. However, unless you're using an Apple product, the browser is inaccessible on other devices since it is no longer supported on Windows systems.</p>
